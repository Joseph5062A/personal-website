This service in turn enabled competitive VEXU robots to compete fully autonomously in real time against robots from other universities.",
        "My primary contributions to the project were on the computer vision pipeline. For this pipeline, we used a YOLOv5 object identification model that was trained on 500+ hand-labeled images using MSOE's super computer. Inference for this model was run on-robot on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Once bounding boxes of objects were identified, ROS2 TF2 was used with the depth information to transform the object vectors to the coordinate frame of the field."],

The project had two primary goals. The first goal was to investigate how the severity of lesions to glomeruli can be objectively assessed given kidney cross-sections, and the second goal was to create a pipeline that would assist renal pathologists in their work of detecting glomeruli damage in kidneys. To achieve both of these objectives, we implemented and experimented with multiple approaches including but not limited to Convolution Neural Networks, Clustering, and Principal Component Analysis."],
